## Suggestion
* I think prof. Ng's exercises are really helpful for new machine learning people, and I also recommend you not only finish the course work, but also look at the whole codes prof. Ng provides.
* Think why simple algorithm can work very well in big data
## Books
* Introduction to Statistic Learning
* The Elements of Statistic Learning
* Python Machine Learning
